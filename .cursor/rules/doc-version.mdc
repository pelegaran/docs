# Documentation version

Whenever you add or change content in this documentation (any .mdx or related doc files), you must increment the **documentation version** so readers can verify they are viewing the latest version.

- The version is defined in a single place: **`snippets/doc-version.mdx`**
- It is displayed on the Welcome page (`index.mdx`) and on the API Introduction page (`api-reference/introduction.mdx`).
- To bump the version: edit `snippets/doc-version.mdx` and update the version number (e.g. from `1.0` to `1.1` for small updates, or `2.0` for a major doc release). No other files need to be changed.
