All requests to the API must be authenticated with a valid API key. If you don't have an API key, please reach out to our support team.

## Authentication

You can authenticate by providing your API key in the HTTP header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.mindshare.so/report/get-customer-details" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```


## Best Practices
- Keep your API keys secret and never expose them in client-side code.
- Rotate your API keys regularly and immediately if you suspect they've been compromised.
- Use environment variables to store API keys rather than hardcoding them in your application.
